# Reverse Engineer
Using TCPView we will see that VulnServer listens on port 9999.
We can connect using `NetCat`:
```
ncat 127.0.0.1 9999
```

And we will have an interactive connection that will help us understand the commands:
```
Welcome to Vulnerable Server! Enter HELP for help.
HELP
Valid Commands:
HELP
STATS [stat_value]
RTIME [rtime_value]
LTIME [ltime_value]
SRUN [srun_value]
TRUN [trun_value]
GMON [gmon_value]
GDOG [gdog_value]
KSTET [kstet_value]
GTER [gter_value]
HTER [hter_value]
LTER [lter_value]
KSTAN [lstan_value]
EXIT
```

We will fuzz each command to understand what command is vulnerable.
We will find out that `KSTET` is vulnerable:
```
buffer = b"KSTET " + b"A" * size
```

We will have:
- EIP offset 70 bytes
- we only have 20 bytes available after the EIP

Using `STATS {string}` command we are able to write any bytes in memory at a random addres.
